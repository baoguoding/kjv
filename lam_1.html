<tr><td width=50>1:1</td><td>先前满有人民的城，现在何竟独坐。先前在列国中为大的，现在竟如寡妇。先前在诸省中为王后的，现在成为进贡的。<br>How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how is she become as a widow! she that was great among the nations, and princess among the provinces, how is she become tributary!</td></tr>

<tr><td width=50>1:2</td><td>她夜间痛哭，泪流满腮。在一切所亲爱的中间没有一个安慰她的。她的朋友都以诡诈待她，成为她的仇敌。<br>She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks: among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her: all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies.</td></tr>

<tr><td width=50>1:3</td><td>犹大因遭遇苦难，又因多服劳苦就迁到外邦。她住在列国中，寻不着安息。追逼她的都在狭窄之地将她追上。<br>Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between the straits.</td></tr>

<tr><td width=50>1:4</td><td>锡安的路径因无人来守圣节就悲伤。她的城门凄凉。她的祭司叹息。她的处女受艰难，自己也愁苦。<br>The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts: all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she is in bitterness.</td></tr>

<tr><td width=50>1:5</td><td>她的敌人为首。她的仇敌亨通。因耶和华为她许多的罪过使她受苦。她的孩童被敌人掳去。<br>Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the LORD hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: her children are gone into captivity before the enemy.</td></tr>

<tr><td width=50>1:7</td><td>耶路撒冷在困苦窘迫之时，就追想古时一切的乐境。她百姓落在敌人手中，无人救济。敌人看见，就因她的荒凉嗤笑。<br>Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her: the adversaries saw her, and did mock at her sabbaths.</td></tr>

<tr><td width=50>1:8</td><td>耶路撒冷大大犯罪，所以成为不洁之物。素来尊敬她的，见她赤露就都藐视她。她自己也叹息退后。<br>Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed: all that honoured her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.</td></tr>

<tr><td width=50>1:9</td><td>她的污秽是在衣襟上。她不思想自己的结局，所以非常地败落，无人安慰她。她说，耶和华阿，求你看我的苦难，因为仇敌夸大。<br>Her filthiness is in her skirts; she remembereth not her last end; therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no comforter. O LORD, behold my affliction: for the enemy hath magnified himself.</td></tr>

<tr><td width=50>1:15</td><td>主轻弃我中间的一切勇士，招聚多人（原文作大会）攻击我，要压碎我的少年人。主将犹大居民踹下，像在酒榨中一样。<br>The LORD hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the midst of me: he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men: the LORD hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, as in a winepress.</td></tr>

<tr><td width=50>1:18</td><td>耶和华是公义的。他这样待我，是因我违背他的命令。众民哪，请听我的话，看我的痛夸。我的处女和少年人都被掳去。<br>The LORD is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment: hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my sorrow: my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity.</td></tr>
